# Introduction

One of the classes in pMineR devoted to _Process Discovery_ is the **Care Flow Miner class**. It enables the creation of a graph outlining the most frequent paths starting from an Event Log and allows inferential analysis to be done on it.
Again, the first step is to create an object of the Care Flow Miner class as follows:

```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

library(pMineR)

```
  
```{r,echo=TRUE}

objCFM<-careFlowMiner()

```
  
  
The following step is to load the event Log through the **loadDataset()** function. this function requires as input the output of the _getData()_ function from the DataLoader calss:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

objDL<-dataLoader()
objDL$load.csv(nomeFile = "EventLog1.csv",IDName = "ID",EVENTName = "Event",dateColumnName = "Date",format.column.date = "%Y-%m-%d",quote = ",")
obj.out<-objDL$getData()

objCFM<-careFlowMiner()
objCFM$loadDataset(obj.out)

```
